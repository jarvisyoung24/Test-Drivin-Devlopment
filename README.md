Tech Quiz Test Suite
--------------------


Description
------------
The Tech Quiz Test Suite is designed to enhance the functionality and reliability of a fully functioning Tech Quiz application using Cypress for both component and end-to-end testing. The application, built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), allows users to take a quiz of ten random tech questions and view their final score. This project will add automated testing to ensure that the quiz functions as expected in all scenarios, providing a more reliable user experience.

Motivation
This project emphasizes the importance of automated testing in modern web applications. By adding Cypress tests to the Tech Quiz application, we ensure that the app works as expected under various conditions, both from a component and an end-to-end perspective. This not only helps with maintaining the application but also allows for faster iteration and deployment while ensuring consistency and robustness.

User Story
------------
AS AN aspiring developer
I WANT to take a tech quiz
SO THAT I can test my knowledge and improve my skills

Acceptance Criteria
---------------------
GIVEN I am taking a tech quiz,
WHEN I click the start button,
THEN the quiz starts, and I am presented with a question.
WHEN I answer a question,
THEN I am presented with another question.
WHEN all questions are answered,
THEN the quiz is over.
WHEN the quiz is over,
THEN I can view my score.
WHEN the quiz is over,
THEN I can start a new quiz.

Technologies Used
-------------------
Cypress (for component and end-to-end testing)
React (for the front-end of the quiz)
MongoDB (for the database)
Node.js (for the back-end API)
Express.js (for the server application)

Write Tests

Implement component tests for the Quiz component in the Quiz.cy.jsx file.
Implement end-to-end tests for the quiz flow in the quiz.cy.js file.
Run Tests
Use the following command to run the tests:

bash
Copy code
npm run test
Video Submission
Follow the Full-Stack Blog video submission guide for guidance on creating and sharing a video.

Testing with Cypress
- Component Testing
Component tests will validate the functionality of individual components such as buttons, inputs, and form submissions. This ensures that each component of the quiz behaves as expected in isolation.

- End-to-End Testing
End-to-end tests will simulate the full user experience, from starting the quiz to answering questions and seeing the final score. This helps ensure that the entire flow of the quiz works correctly and that the system behaves as expected under different scenarios.

Example Component Test
Here’s an example of a Cypress component test for the Quiz component:

javascript
Copy code
describe('Quiz Component', () => {
  it('should render a question when the quiz starts', () => {
    cy.visit('/quiz');
    cy.get('.start-button').click();
    cy.get('.question').should('exist');
  });

  it('should move to the next question when an answer is selected', () => {
    cy.get('.answer-button').first().click();
    cy.get('.question').should('not.exist');
    cy.get('.next-button').click();
  });

  it('should show the score when the quiz is over', () => {
    cy.get('.finish-button').click();
    cy.get('.score').should('be.visible');
  });
});
Example End-to-End Test
Here’s an example of an end-to-end test for the quiz process:

javascript
Copy code
describe('Tech Quiz End-to-End', () => {
  it('should run through the entire quiz and show the score', () => {
    cy.visit('/quiz');
    cy.get('.start-button').click();
    cy.get('.answer-button').each(($el) => {
      cy.wrap($el).click();
      cy.get('.next-button').click();
    });
    cy.get('.finish-button').click();
    cy.get('.score').should('be.visible');
  });
});
